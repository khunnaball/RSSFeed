# RSS Feed Project

A RSS Feed project using PHP, jQuery, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 3.4.

<b>Difficulties/Challenges: </b>

* The RSS feeds did not have any images/thumbnails therefore I had to scrape them from the article page using the URL.  
This was not too much of an issue but did take a little bit of time to figure out the best way to do it, I believe this can still be improved on to improve speed and effectiveness. 
I attempted this 2 different ways, the first way duplicated images whereas the second worked alot better.

<b>Improvements/Changes I would make:</b>

* Improve the speed in which the thumbnails are collected, currently takes a few seconds to load the data as it carries out the function which would increase usability. 
Adding caching to the images would also decrease load time and improve the overall usability of the site.

* Improve the way I show more of the articles when the 'Show More' button is pressed by making use of an offset to load only new results etc.

* Update to Bootstrap 4 to make use of things like cards etc.

* Improve overall styling of the page, I wanted to follow a dark mode style theme as it appeals to me and has less strain on the eyes when looking at it.

* Make use of SASS and Gulp to create Gulp task to convert the SASS to CSS. I have never used either SASS or Gulp but when I was looking into them they looked very useful and handy to automate things and increase effectiveness.
